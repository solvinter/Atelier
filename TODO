## TODO – Annexe

- **Ventilation gaps**  
  The openings leading up into the bathroom roof need to be closed by a mason.

- **South wall – wood structure**  
  Extend the thick wooden pillars of the south wall all the way up to the roof.

- **South wall – mosquito net**  
  After extending the wooden pillars to the ceiling, install mosquito netting over the remaining gaps.

- **Painting**  
  Paint all walls white, inside and outside, except for the foundation.

- **Terrace**  
  Use flat stones, carefully fitted together as a puzzle.  
  This must be done very delicately by an experienced mason / tiles-man.  
  Aim to minimise the use of cement — the smaller the gaps, the better.

- **Foundation**  
  Use the same technique as on the main building’s foundation  
  (small pieces of seashell).  
  Clarify details with the mason.

- **Finish – teak (oil, not sealing)**  
  Use *marine teak oil*.  
  Ask specifically for *oil for outdoor teak*.
