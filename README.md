# Atelier
First satellite building for privacy and peace of mind at Blackrocks

Atelier – How to read this repository

This repository documents the planning of the atelier annexe at Blackrocks — its aesthetics, function, and relationship to the main building.
It is not a software project in the usual sense, but a shared thinking space.

Who this is for
	•	For Sebastian: you need not to spend time learning a new application - this is just a website that is designed for strukturing and collaborating on something together coveiniently. Think of it as a structured notebook rather than a technical system.
	•	For Emily: you’ll likely recognise the structure already — feel free to skim or dive where it makes sense.

How to read it (simple version)

You don’t need to read everything, and you don’t need to read it in order.
	•	Start with the README files — they explain intent and context.
	•	Each folder focuses on one aspect (space, function, materials, infrastructure, etc.).
	•	Text is written to be read like notes or a planning document, not like code.

If something feels unclear, that usually means it’s still open for discussion, not that you’ve missed something.

What this repository is not
	•	It’s not a final plan.
	•	It’s not a fixed decision document.
	•	It’s not a technical manual you’re expected to memorise.

It’s closer to a shared map of how the atelier is meant to feel, work, and remain calm and private in relation to the main building.

How to interact with it
	•	Read casually — small pieces at a time is fine.
	•	Comment or ask questions if something stands out.
	•	No pressure to “keep up”; changes happen slowly and intentionally.

Guiding principle

The atelier exists to provide privacy, quiet, and separation, while still being connected to Blackrocks as a whole.
This repository exists to support that same calm, thoughtful process.
