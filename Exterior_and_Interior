# Interior / Exterior

This document outlines **proposed ideas and directions** for the interior and exterior of the atelier annexe at Blackrocks.

Nothing here is final.  
The text is meant to support shared understanding, discussion, and gradual decision-making, rather than to lock anything in place.

The overall intention is to explore how the annexe could provide calm, privacy, and everyday usability, while remaining gently connected to the main building.

## Exterior (proposals)

### Walls
- Exterior wall finishes could follow the same or a closely related colour as the main building.
- This would help maintain visual continuity across the site.
- South-facing elements may need particular attention to mosquito-tight detailing, depending on final use and openings.

### Terrace
- One possible approach for the terrace surface is the use of **broken tiles**, a locally established material often used for mosaic work.
- Broken tiles can be sourced by weight and allow for a flexible, crafted surface.
- If chosen, the work would benefit from a mason experienced with this technique.
- The aim would be a surface that feels deliberate, durable, and calm rather than improvised.

### General exterior intention
The exterior could aim to feel:
- Quiet rather than expressive
- Durable rather than refined
- Clearly related to Blackrocks, while remaining secondary to the main building

## Interior (proposals)

### Floors
- Wooden flooring is one possible direction.
- Using the same floor type as in the bedroom of the main building could create material continuity, though this is optional.
- The general preference is for a surface that feels warm, natural, and comfortable for everyday use.

### Walls and colour
- Interior walls would likely be painted.
- Colour choices remain open and should be decided collaboratively.
- Calm, light, non-distracting tones are a current preference rather than a fixed choice.
- Emily’s input would be valuable in shaping the final palette.

### Light and atmosphere
- The interior could be shaped to support rest and quiet activity.
- Visual simplicity is preferred over technical or visually busy solutions.
- The space should invite slow use, not productivity pressure.

## Furniture (proposals)

### General approach
- Furniture could be partly or fully custom-built over time.
- Simplicity, durability, and calm proportions are guiding ideas rather than strict rules.

### Process
- Initial sketches could help clarify needs and spatial relationships.
- Furniture does not need to be built all at once and can evolve gradually.
- Emily’s involvement in defining use, form, and feel is encouraged.

### Possible uses
- Rest
- Quiet work
- Creative activities such as drawing, painting, or ceramics
- Everyday living with clear separation from the main building

## Guiding intention

The annexe is imagined as a space that could offer:
- Privacy from the main building
- Physical and mental quiet
- A gentle but clear separation of spaces

All interior and exterior choices can be evaluated against this intention as the project develops.
